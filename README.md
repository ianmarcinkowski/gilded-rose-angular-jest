# Angular Pairing Training exercise with the Gilded Rose problem

This is an implementation of
[Emily Bache's Gilded Rose refactoring kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)
in an Angular front-end app, but using Jest.  Perhaps one day I'll submit
this as a PR to the original repo.

This is intended as a pairing exercise with other devs at work.
