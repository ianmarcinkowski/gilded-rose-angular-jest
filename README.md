# App

This is an implementation of
[Emily Bache's Gilded Rose refactoring kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)
in an Angular front-end app, which can be extended during pair programming practice inside of a
working Angular app.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
